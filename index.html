		<h1>Looking for Volunteers</h1>
		As of now front end web devs are needed for keeping this page updated, cause as you can see
		with inspect element front end aint my forte. </br>
		And designers to draw cute Hatsune Mikus and a new logo >:3</br>
		<h2>NEWS</h2>
		In version 1.00 support for a Quantum Abstract
		Machine vm will be added as well as suport for the Quil 
		instruction set. The Quantum Abstract Machine VM 
		will be based on the following <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03355">doc<a/>
</br>
	
		the 0.01 release will add support only for POSIX based systems
		elf executables and the x86 instruction set , 16 bit , 32bit and 64 bit  		
		</br>
		As of now the author is focusing on gathering a team of programmers to form the basis for our main developmen team
		which will be tasked with developing the language design, compiler design(implementing llvm as well as designing our own backend)
		</br>
		NOTE THE GIT REPOSITORY IS MAINLY TO DUMP SCRAP CODES AND CAN HEAVILLY CHANGE FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE OTHER 
		compiler designs and high level diagrams will be posted to the github.io pages as soon as the author gathers a team and 
		finalizes the compiler design. 
		</br>
		The actual code being written by the sole author is as of now towards implementing the MikuVM and MCMP(MikuC Memory Protection layer)
		which is a framework designed not to be used only by the MikuC language and VM but as well as any C/C++ program 
		</br>  
		<h2>Begginer Programmers Guide</h2>
		The following document is for advanced programmers if your starting out 
		folloe the following link <a href="res/begginer.html">guide</a>
		

		<h2>What is the MikuC or MikuChan Programming Language</h2>
	
	The MikuChan programming language is a Object Oriented Programming Language with
	pre processore macro and runtime macro support as well as types built by tags and properties ,out of the box. And a light VM for 
	optional garbage collection or just memory leaks prevention fuzzing framework and future web enbedding support.</br></br>

	<h2>Hello World</h2>
	<div class="code" &nbsp>
		/*</br>
		*	Hello World! in MikuC</br>
		*</br>
		*/</br>
		 @load("OS")</br>
		 @load("UWU") //standard library is called UWU</br>
		 @load("WEB")</br>
		</br>
		OS::Ret main(arg :UWU::Args) {</br>
					      </br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;UWU::console::println("Hello World");</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;let server = WEB::Apache::build();</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;//build a web apache server and get it running</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;server.add.style("default");</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;server.println("Hello World");</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;//same as server.add.html("Hello World");</br></br>
					      </br>
					      </br>
			return OS::Ret::Ok;       </br>
		} 			      </br>
	</div>			
	
	<h2>Types</h2>
		
	The following primitive types exist:</br>
	Note that they are found in the following path "$UWU/types.mch", $UWU represent the standard installation path on your sys</br>	
		<ul>	
			<li><p class="high">tag</p>This is a generic struct which has the following values
					<ul>
						<li>byte_quant :u32,</li>
						<li>properties :#Box</li></ul>NOTE: @Tup is a standard preprocessing macro which will size auto size to fit the quant of 
						elements inside at compile time 
			<li><p class="high">u8</p>unsigned 8bit variable, built by byte_quant = 1; properties@app(@init(0))</li> NOTE this will make so properties tupple has its @app "append" property called and passed the @init propertrit whichw will set all u8 primitives to be initially 0  
			<li><p class="high">u16</p>unsigned 16 bit variable, built by byte_quant = 2; properties@stdprim </li>NOTE  @stdprim has @app(@init(0)) and all other properties append requests that an std primitive has 
			<l1><p class="high">u32</p></li>
			<li><p class="high">u64</p></li>
			
			<li><p class="high">f32</p></li> signed floating point 32bit number 	
			<li><p class="high">f64</p></li> signed floating point 64bit number
			<li><p class="high">str</p></li> represents a slice of string ASCII always endend by a \0 character
			<li><p class="high">str64</p></li> represent a slice of string Unicode
			
			<li>u64</l1>

		</ul>

	<h2>What is a Pre Processor Macro?</h2>
	Like in C a pre processor macro is identified by the pound sign </br>
	<p class="code">1. #DOCIFY</p>
	
	Unlike C though instead of only building code at the preprocessing stages it also MikuC 
	and C Scripts to work with compiler 

	There exists also runtime macros which run along side the main thread 
	identified by the at sign 
	<p class="code">1. @load("UWU")</p>
	this runtime macro is similar to the import keyword in java were in java it makes the class loader 
	load a class herer the @load runtime macro loads a lib.</br></br> 
	
	The $UWU path variable refers to the root path were the headerds are stored for the MikuChan Programming Language
	A .mc file contains MikuC source code while a .mch is mostly used for the  #include macro which is mostly
	used for the macro creations to use libraries the runtime macro @load("libname") is used.</br></br> 
	 	
	<div class="code">
		1.#Example { </br>
		2.</br>
		3.	#include<$UWU/macro.mch> </br>
		4.
		5.} </br>
	</div> </br>
	
	<h2>MikuVM and the MCMP</h2>
	The MikuC Memleak Prevention framework or MCMP is wrapper for the basic
	memory operations like pointer arithimethics, malloc and free. Registering what happens and logging it.</br></br>
	
	
	It will be also used as a debugger and include a fuzzing framework.</br>
