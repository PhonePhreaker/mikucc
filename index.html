		<h2>NEWS</h2>
		In version 1.00 support for a Quantum Abstract
		Machine vm will be added as well as suport for the Quil 
		instruction set. The Quantum Abstract Machine VM 
		will be based on the following <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03355">doc<a/>
</br>
	
		the 0.01 release will add support only for linux systems
		elf executables and the x86 instruction set , 16 bit , 32bit and 64 bit  		
	
		<h2>Begginer Programmers Guide</h2>
		The following document is for advanced programmers if your starting out 
		folloe the following link <a href="res/begginer.html">guide</a>
		

		<h2>What is the MikuC or MikuChan Programming Language</h2>
	
	The MikuChan programming language is a Object Oriented Programming Language with
	pre processore macro and runtime macro support as well as types built by tags and properties ,out of the box. And a light VM for 
	optional garbage collection or just memory leaks prevention fuzzing framework and future web enbedding support.</br></br>

	<h2>Hello World</h2>
	<div class="code" &nbsp>
		/*</br>
		*	Hello World! in MikuC</br>
		*</br>
		*/</br>
		 @load("OS")</br>
		 @load("UWU") //standard library is called UWU</br>
		 @load("WEB")</br>
		</br>
		OS::Ret main(arg :UWU::Args) {</br>
					      </br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;UWU::console::println("Hello World");</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;let server = WEB::Apache::build();</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;//build a web apache server and get it running</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;server.add.style("default");</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;server.println("Hello World");</br></br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;//same as server.add.html("Hello World");</br></br>
					      </br>
					      </br>
			return OS::Ret::Ok;       </br>
		} 			      </br>
	</div>			
	
	<h2>Types</h2>
		
	The following primitive types exist:</br>
	Note that they are found in the following path "$UWU/types.mch", $UWU represent the standard installation path on your sys</br>	
		<ul>	
			<li><p class="high">tag</p>This is a generic struct which has the following values
					<ul>
						<li>byte_quant :u32,</li>
						<li>properties :@Tup</li></ul>NOTE: @Tup is a standard runtime macro representing a Tuple
			<li><p class="high">u8</p>unsigned 8bit variable, built by byte_quant = 1; properties@app(@init(0))</li> NOTE this will make so properties tupple has its @app "append" property called and passed the @init propertrit whichw will set all u8 primitives to be initially 0  
			<li><p class="high">u16</p>unsigned 16 bit variable, built by byte_quant = 2; properties@stdprim </li>NOTE  @stdprim has @app(@init(0)) and all other properties append requests that an std primitive has 
			<l1><p class="high">u32</p></li>
			<li><p class="high">u64</p></li>
			
			<li><p class="high">f32</p></li> signed floating point 32bit number 	
			<li><p class="high">f64</p></li> signed floating point 64bit number
			<li><p class="high">str</p></li> represents a slice of string ASCII always endend by a \0 character
			<li><p class="high">str64</p></li> represent a slice of string Unicode
			
			<li>u64</l1>

		</ul>

	<h2>What is a Pre Processor Macro?</h2>
	Like in C a pre processor macro is identified by the pound sign </br>
	<p class="code">1. #DOCIFY</p>
	
	Unlike C though instead of only building code at the preprocessing stages it also MikuC 
	and C Scripts to work with compiler 

	There exists also runtime macros which run along side the main thread 
	identified by the at sign 
	<p class="code">1. @load("UWU")</p>
	this runtime macro is similar to the import keyword in java were in java it makes the class loader 
	load a class herer the @load runtime macro loads a lib.</br></br> 
	
	The $UWU path variable refers to the root path were the headerds are stored for the MikuChan Programming Language
	A .mc file contains MikuC source code while a .mch is mostly used for the  #include macro which is mostly
	used for the macro creations to use libraries the runtime macro @load("libname") is used.</br></br> 
	 	
	<div class="code">
		1.#Example { </br>
		2.</br>
		3.	#include<$UWU/macro.mch> </br>
		4.
		5.} </br>
	</div> </br>
	
	<h2>MikuVM and the MCMP</h2>
	The MikuC Memleak Prevention framework or MCMP is wrapper for the basic
	memory operations like pointer arithimethics, malloc and free. Registering what happens and logging it.</br></br>
	
	
	It will be also used as a debugger and include a fuzzing framework.</br>
